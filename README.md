# Mix code resources
  
This repository will be used to stock some simple but useful pieces of code developed with different aims.  
They are structured by code language.  
  
Also, I have another github repository where I upload some public scripts that I have used to learn about artificial intelligence, take a look [here](https://github.com/aitorvv96/road_to_AI).
